	Package fmt implements formatted I/O with functions analogous
	to C's printf and scanf.  The format 'verbs' are derived from C's but
	are simpler.


	Printing

	The verbs:

	General:
		%v	the value in a default format
			when printing structs, the plus flag (%+v) adds field names
		%#v	a Go-syntax representation of the value
		%T	a Go-syntax representation of the type of the value
		%%	a literal percent sign; consumes no value
